# LendingClub-Data-Analysis

This is a group project for TAMU STAT656. The contributers include: HuitingSheng, Hua Zou and Lixin Wang(myself).

LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It is the first peer-to-peer lender to register its 
offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. 

Our goal is to use the data provided in order to predict if the borrower will repay the loan by its maturity date or not. In particular, we will focus on customer's
who are deemed high risk for default/charge-off.

In this project, our two main questions are
1. What features that might be most related to the default loan?
2. How do we predict a new customer's loan default using statistical learning method?

The models we use in this project include Logistic Elastic Net, Boosting with Accuracy, Boosting with Kappa. 

A Rshiny app is built to show the sensitivity and specificity at different threshold for each model.
