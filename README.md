# LendingClub-Data-Analysis

This is a group project for TAMU STAT656. The contributers include: Hua "Amanda" Zou, Huiting Sheng and Lixin "Zoe" Wang.

LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its 
offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. 

Our goal is to use the data provided in order to predict if the borrower will repay the loan by its maturity date or not. In particular, we will focus on customer's
who are deemed high risk for default/charge-off.

A Rshiny app is built to show the sensitivity and specificity at different threshold for each model.
